## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To get started with this project, you'll need the following installed on your system:

1. Git: for cloning the repository.
2. TouchDesigner or Grasshoper and Rhino: for running the code.

You can download these from their respective websites.

### Installation

To install this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Awangardajazz/EyetrackingHeadset-Pupil3D-expanded.git`
2. Follow detailed steps as outlined in `https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil`
3. Download the .TD file

## 3D Model Files

In the `3D_Models` directory, you'll find all the necessary files for 3D printing the Pupil Labs headset. To view, modify or assemble the model use `Eyetracking-Headset-Model3D.3dm` to print use the `Eyetracking-Headset-Model3D-SLS-print.3dm` file located in the `3D_Models` directory. The geometry prepared for SLS 3D printing is enclosed by bounding box for +/- 249 cubic centimeters, making the print  affordable.
